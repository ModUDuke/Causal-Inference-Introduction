title: Causal Inference with R - Introduction
description: Welcome to the introduction of our 7 course series on causal inference
  concepts and methods created by Duke University with support from eBay, Inc. Designed to teach you causal inference concepts, methods,
  and how to code in R with realistic data, this introduction focuses on how to interpret
  treatment effects, and how to explore and derive key summary statistics from dataframes.
  Weâ€™ll stay away from dense statistical math and focus instead on higher level concepts
  that data scientists need to always consider when examining and making inferences
  about data.
