title            : Causal Inference with R - Introduction
description      : Welcome to the introduction of our 7 course series on causal inference concepts and methods created by Duke University's Social Sciences Research Institute with support from eBay, Inc. The goal of these courses is to teach you how to make reasonable causal inferences and methodological, and to learn how to code in R with realistic data. 
This course focuses on how to interpret treatment effects, and will teach users how to explore and derive key summary statistics from dataframes. Whereas many introductory courses in data science can delve very deep into the math behind statistical models, this course aims at explaining the higher level concepts that we as data scientists need to consider when examining and making inferences about our data.
This course is designed for users with almost no background in R, but new users may want to first complete DataCamp's "Free Introduction to R" (chapters 1, 2, and 5) before beginning, and the R exercises have optional dplyr support. We hope you find the course useful and enjoyable, so letâ€™s get started!
